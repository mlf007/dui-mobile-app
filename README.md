# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up Mapbox API Key

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or add to your existing `.env`):
   
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY=your-mapbox-api-key-here
   ```
   
   **Get your Mapbox API key:**
   1. Go to https://account.mapbox.com/
   2. Sign up or log in
   3. Go to your account page
   4. Copy your default public token (or create a new one)
   5. Add it to your `.env` file as `EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY`
   
   Alternatively, you can add it to `app.json` in the `extra.mapboxApiKey` field.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
